#Decoding-Mouse-Brain

I have applied common unsupervised and supervised learning methods to a neural activity dataset in 
Stringer, Pachitariu et. al. Nature 2019 [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1346-5].

Authors showed bunch of natural images from ImageNet dataset to mice and imaged visual cortex (V1 layer)
activity with two photon microscopy. In this tutorial, I am interested decoding the images animals look at
from neural firing rates in the visual cortex.
